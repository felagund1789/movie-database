### 🌙 Dark Mode

This project supports "dark mode" styling, and by default it will follow the color preference on your device. It also allows for overriding this using buttons at the top right of the screen, which will persist the preference to local storage on your device. More info about color preference web API's can be found here: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
